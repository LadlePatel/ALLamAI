  // However, if specific context values from useNextTheme are needed application-wide, this structure can be useful.
  
  // For now, we'll assume RootLayout handles the main provider setup.
  // This component will just pass children through, or could provide a context if needed.
  // If `next-themes` is used in `layout.tsx`, this custom provider is mostly a pass-through or for specific overrides.
  // The prompt to create a custom hook was if `next-themes` wasn't available.
  // Since `next-themes` is *not* in package.json, the previous `use-theme.ts` and this simplified provider are more relevant.
  // Reverting to a simple structure for this custom provider.

  // For this exercise, we will assume next-themes is handling things at RootLayout
  // and this component can be simplified or removed if RootLayout does everything.
  // However, the request implies creating a ThemeProvider, so a minimal one is provided.
  // The `useTheme` hook from next-themes is what should be used by ThemeToggle.
  
  // Let's assume the task is to make this provider work with the custom `use-theme.ts` if `next-themes` wasn't there.
  // Given `next-themes` is now added to layout.tsx, this custom provider is less critical.
  // The most direct way is to use `useTheme` from `next-themes` in `ThemeToggle`.

  // If we *were* to use the custom `use-theme.ts`:
  // const value = useCustomThemeHook(); // from a hypothetical `use-custom-theme.ts`
  // return <ThemeProviderContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</ThemeProviderContext.Provider>;
  
  // Since layout.tsx uses next-themes' ThemeProvider, this component mainly serves to illustrate
  // where a custom theme context might live. Consumers should use `useTheme` from `next-themes`.
  return <>{children}</>;
